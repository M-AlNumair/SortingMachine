# SortingMachine
Color based object sorting machine 

I will be adding all the details of this project within the next two weeks. 

1.Hardware components. 
2.The code for taking the pictures and processing them.
3.A convolutional neural network model for predicting objects and their color. 
4.Using the model to tell the robotic arm what the detected object is in order for it to place it into its correct location.
5.A video demo of the project.
